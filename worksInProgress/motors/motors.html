				<div class="introduction">
					<p>
						Anything that moves has potential for making sound, and
						motors, by definition, move. Usually the movement is the part we
						want to exploit, but artists have been exploring the sonic
						potential of motors (e.g. the work of
						<a href="https://www.zimoun.net">Zimoun</a>
						or this example of
						<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DBnGYMPaf4">stepper motor music</a>)

						<i>Motors</i> is a musical instrument consisting of many different
						motors and motor mechanisms. The motors
						are not embellished with any additional sound making devices, so
						that the sound heard is only that of the motor and the mechanism.
						Motors and mechanisms are preferably salvaged or found, but new
						motors and mechanisms are used as well. Each device is
						individually controlled via MIDI.

					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="introduction">
					<p>
						<i>Motors</i> is not a stand-alone structure; rather, it is
						a site-specific installation mounted along walls, hanging from
						the ceiling, and on the floor. Some free standing structures may
						be used as well.

					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="introduction">
					<p>
						Like other musical instruments, the output of this instrument
						is the music it produces. I collaborate with composers who would
						compose a piece specifically for the site. My collaborators also
						advise during the instrument construction to achieve the desired
						sounds.

					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="introduction">
					<p>
						Composition can begin only when the instrument is complete, as
						until then we can't be sure what it will sound like. The composer
						controls each device via a MIDI keyboard, and by listening to the
						resultant sounds decides what to compose. The resultant
						composition can be pre-programmed or performed live, and can
						potentially be accompanied by other instruments.
