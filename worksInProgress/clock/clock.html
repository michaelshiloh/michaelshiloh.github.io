				<div class="introduction">
					<p>
					Inspired by large mechanical clocks such as The Rathaus-Glockenspiel
					in Munich, which tells two stories, the Anker clock in Vienna,
					featuring a parade of historical figures while playing music of
					their era, and modern interpretations such as those by Tim Hunkins,
					for this project I will build an electro-mechanical clock out of
					locally sourced salvaged materials and mechanisms. At the end of the
					residency the clock will remain, as a work of art, as a timekeeper,
					and as a celebration of mechanisms.

					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="introduction">
					<p>
					These mechanisms would not be part of the time keeping system;
					rather, they perform gratuitous mechanical activity: moderate
					activity on the quarter-hour, more on the half-hour, and all-out on
					the hour. The various activities would be on a theme which will be
					determined when inspired by the site and gathered materials.

					</p>

				<div class="introduction">
					<p>
					I have long been fascinated by mechanisms and the ingenuity of
					converting one type of motion to another. In the 21st century it is
					increasingly rare to see mechanisms as they are either replaced with
					electronic counterparts or hidden.  I have observed that my students
					(and indeed the general public) seem to accept this "black box"
					either as something unimportant that is undeserving of attention
					(and perhaps even shameful to consider) or as something so complex
					as to be beyond the grasp of all but the most elite and nearly
					magical.  Indeed, Frank Popper wrote “The introduction, suggestion
					and employment of machine movements in art, can be equated with the
					idea of the identiﬁcation with the industrial and mechanical
					universe that is as much within the ﬁeld of magic as that of
					aesthetics” (1968, 235). One goal of this clock is to draw attention
					to and celebrate these mechanisms.

					Using salvaged materials critiques capitalist consumerism, which
					encourages discarding and replacing broken, old, or out of style
					items. I identify with a growing movement demanding that products be
					designed for maintenance, repair, and a long life.
