					<h2> New Interface for Musical Expression on a piece of wood </h2>
				</div>

				<div class="introduction">
					<p>
						This project combines a classic sound making device with 
						an even older, but rarely used, circuit building technique
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="introduction">
					<p>
						This isn't really a new interface - Forrest M. Mims III first
						published in 1980 a circuit for what he called a "Stepped Tone
						Generator". It is now commonly known as an Atari Punk Console
						because it sounds like the early video games of the 80s and has
						developed a bit of a cult following.  
					</p> 
				</div>

				<div class="introduction">
					
					<p> In the original
						design the device was controlled by two potentiometers. A common
						modification is to replace these with two photoresistors, allowing
						it to be controlled by blocking the light to these sensors, giving
						it a bit of a Theremin-like feel. Flashing lights can add an
						interesting effect, and there are endless ways to build and modify
						this device.  
					</p> 
				</div>

				<div class="introduction">
					
					<p> In this workshop we will construct the
						circuit on a piece of wood, using small nails as the tie points
						and using point-to-point wiring. (Using a piece of wood on which
						to build a circuit is what gives as the term breadboarding.). The
						wood can be of any shape, and the circuit can be laid out in
						almost any way, encouraging a great deal of creativity.  
					</p>
