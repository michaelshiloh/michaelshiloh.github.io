						Artist Statement
					</h2>
				</div>
				<div class="introduction">
					<p>
						I have a passion for building things, taking things apart, and
						using the bits that I find to make new things.  I love
						experimenting with new ideas, new devices, and new techniques.  I
						like using parts in ways for which they were not intended.  I like
						setting up situations where people have experiences that they may
						not have otherwise.

					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="introduction">
					<p>
						My research interests include
						how people behave around robots, unusual mechanisms,
						and surprising uses of technology.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="introduction">
					<p>
						My practice includes  participatory art, machine art, experimental
						sound art, and conceptual furniture.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="introduction">
					<p>
						My aesthetic is rough and unrefined. I like to use discarded,
						surplus, and recycled materials: While the environmental
						advantages are obvious, my reasons are aesthetic and personal:  
						I am drawn to
						items that others consider worthless and I derive great pleasure
						from reusing discarded materials. 
						I favor "DIY" construction techniques and 
						exposed mechanisms because 
						I want people to think "I could make that". (See 
						<i>Who Gets to Play</i>
						below.)

				<div class="introduction">

						My art follows these main themes:

				<div class="introduction">
					<h3> 1: Who gets to play?  </h3>
				</div>
				<div class="introduction">
					<p>
						I'm disturbed by exclusionary attitudes, such as might be
						perceived regarding math or computer programming ("you must be
						this smart to understand this"). I like to set up situations which
						allow/encourage/force visitors to participate in the creation of
						the artwork. I consider this a form of Relational Aesthetics, in
						the sense that I act more as a facilitator than a maker, and I
						regard the art both as the (visitor) constructed result and as the
						information exchanged between the artist and the viewers, and
						between the viewers. I consider this work provocative in that it
						allows unrelated individuals to participate in a common feeling or
						event they might not otherwise experience collectively,
						and it raises questions of identity and qualifications.
						</p>

				<div class="introduction">
					<h5> Examples: </h5>
				</div>
				<div class="introduction">
					<p>
						I set up discarded electrical and electronic devices on tables,
						along with tools. I also strung up wires along the walls carrying
						low voltages.  Visitors disassembled the devices, removed
						components (e.g. motors, LEDs, speakers), and connected them to
						the wires to activate them. I and my volunteers moved between
						participants, assisting in identifying usable components and
						hooking them up.  - "Robots on the March!" Artists' Television
						Access, San Francisco, 2005

				</div>
				<div class="introduction">
					<p>
						I made very simple robots and brought a pair of computers.
						The unprogrammed robots had no
						"personality". Visitors sat at the computers and programmed the
						robots to give them a personality. My assistants and I helped
						explain how to do this, but left the choice of personality up to
						the participants. The robots then ran around the gallery until
						another visitor picked a robot and changed its personality.  -

				</div>
				<div class="introduction">
					<p>
						From 2006 to 2009 I organized and ran a giant workshop at the 
						San Francisco Bay
						Area Maker Faire, in which we gathered about 6 tons of discarded
						electronic, mechanical, and scrap material, provided tools and
						consumables such as wire and batteries, and allowed visitors to
						take things apart and build whatever they wanted. While some were
						highly skilled, the visitors that interested 
						me the most were families
						who started by identifying one "maker" (usually a young boy)
						while the rest claimed to have no such skill.
						After awhile the "non-makers" soon got involved as
						well. This fascinated me because they had overcome their
						self-identification as a non-maker. 
						At the time I didn't situate this as
						an art project, but in retrospect this clearly is a 
						Relational Aesthetics installation.

					<h3> 2. Conceptual Furniture: </h3> 
				</div>
				<div class="introduction">
					<p>
						I made a series of furniture from concrete, scrap wood, scrap
						metal, and broken glass. The furniture appeared dangerous 
						but in fact was quite safe and functional.
						This was an early project (1990s) and I've not made any since,
						perhaps because I've not been inspired by the proper scrap metal
						or and no longer have access to the broken glass from shattered
						bus shelters.  
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="introduction">
					<h3>3. Critical Robotics:</h3>
				</div>
				<div class="introduction">
					<p>
						This series once again challenges exclusionary assumptions, this
						time specifically addressing the assumption that robotics research
						can only be performed by highly trained engineers, in well equipped
						labs, using very expensive and complex equipment and components. My
						robots are designed to be non-precious, encouraging visitors to
						modify them, in some cases mechanically, in others programmatically.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="introduction">
					<h5> Examples: </h5>
				</div>
				<div class="introduction">
					<p>
						Telepresence Robot (Robonica): A very simple mobile platform, a
						little less than human height, with a camera, screen, microphone,
						and loudspeaker, running custom video conferencing software
						accessible via a website. The
						website software allows a remote viewer to "drive" the robot around,
						seeing what the robot sees and hearing what the robot hears, while
						being projected onto the screen and loud speaker of the robot. In
						this way the remote viewer is "projected" into a remote physical
						space, allowing interaction with people there. The purpose of this
						project is not to develop a telepresence robot, but to encourage
						participant and bystanders to make additions or modifications to
						the robot, to see what ideas non-roboticists might come up with.
						Currently available only on the New York University Abu Dhabi
						campus to "drive" or modify.

				<div class="introduction">
					<p>

						Robot with No Personality 2 (Man or Machine): Building on the
						"Robots With No Personality" project from 2009, this is a human
						sized robot that has the ability to express itself in very simple
						ways: changing the shape of its mouth and eyes, moving its ears,
						moving itself, and speaking. The robot approaches visitors and
						engages in very simple conversations.  This robot is paired with a
						"Personality Creation Station" where other visitors select how the
						robot should respond to various situations. Of interest is what
						sort of choices visitors make in choosing the robot's responses,
						and in other visitors' reactions to the robot's behaviour. This
						project is a work in progress.

					<h3>4. Machine Art: </h3>
				</div>
				<div class="introduction">
					<p>
						I've been a part of the machine performance
						group 
						<a href="srl.org"> Survival Research Labs</a>
						for 4 decades,
						putting on
						performances with machines that we build. 
						Each machine is very large and complex,
						interacting with each other and other sets and props.
						SRL performances tell a story, in contrast to later
						derivatives such as Robot Wars and Robo Games.

					<h3>5. Sound Art: </h5>
				</div>
				<div class="introduction">
					<p>
						Combining my interest in experimental music and mechanisms, I have
						made a series of sound making machines. I'm interested in making
						sound in as unconventional way as possible, so I avoid simple
						wind, percussion, and string devices and try to make sound in
						other ways, such as rolling scrap metal in a large metal cylinder
						or bending plastic that creaks when bent.
