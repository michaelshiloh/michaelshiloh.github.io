        <h2>Robots</h2>

				<p>Before you get too excited let's be clear that I am not a
				roboticist. I like to tinker both with technology and people, and
				robots are an interesting way to do that.  These robots are very
				simple, and surely some will argue that they are not robots, which is
				fine with me.  I use the term because that's what most people would
				call them.  
			</p> 

			<p> 
			Goals of these robots:
			<ul>
			<li> 
			Challenge the assumption that 
			robotics research can only be performed
			by highly trained engineers in well-equipped labs using expensive and
			complex equipment and components. My robots are built out of cheap
			materials and intentionally do not look too highly polished
			encouraging visitors to modify them, in some cases
			mechanically,in others programmatically.  
			</li> 

			<li> 
				Explore how people think robots should behave, and how people should
				behave with robots
			</li> 

			<li> 
				Explore what happens when the general public can modify
				a robot, or change the robots behavior
			</li> 

			</ul>

			</p>

				Robot with No Personality 2 (Man or Machine): Building on the "Robots
				With No Personality" project from 2009, this is a human-sized robot
				that can express itself in very simple ways: changing the shape of its
				mouth and eyes, moving its ears, moving itself, and speaking. The
				robot approaches visitors and engages in very simple conversations.
				This robot is paired with a "Personality Creation Station" where other
				visitors select how the robot should respond to various situations. Of
				interest are the choices visitors make in choosing the robot's
				responses and other visitors' reactions to the robot's behavior. This
				robot is under development and needs quite a bit of work.  </p>

        <h2>Telepresence</h2>

				<p>
				Telepresence Robot (Robonica): A very simple mobile platform, a little
				less than human height, with a camera, screen, microphone, and
				loudspeaker, running custom video conferencing software. The software
				allows a remote viewer to "drive" the robot around, seeing what the
				robot sees and hearing what the robot hears while being projected onto
				the screen and loudspeaker of the robot. In this way, the remote
				viewer is "projected" into a remote physical space, allowing
				interaction with people there. The purpose of this project is not to
				develop a telepresence robot but to encourage participant and
				bystanders to make additions or modifications to the robot to see what
				ideas non-roboticists might come up with. The robot is currently
				broken, but the goal was to let make it available to anyone on campus
				to "drive" or modify.  </p> </article>
