						Relational Aesthetics and Participatory Art
					</h2>
				</div>

				<div class="introduction">
					<p>
						In this category of my projects, the work displayed must be
						understood not as objects but as sites of interaction. 
						<i>Relational Aesthetics</i> is a phrase coined by 
						Nicolas Bourriaud in his book <i>Relational Aesthetics</i> (1998).
						Bourriaud asserts that the interpersonal relationships that develop
						in the context of these projects have formal qualities, and it is
						these formal qualities that can give such a work of art its value.

						For reasons discussed later, I use discarded electronic devices as
						my raw material, setting up situations in which visitors, now
						participants, disassemble these devices, and, optionally, can use
						the salvaged parts to create new devices. Visitors will often claim
						that they don't know how to do this, but after awhile, with very
						little, or sometimes no prompting, will timidly pick up the tools
						and get started. Once they start, they often stay for much longer
						than they expected. They describe getting completely
						absorbed and becoming focused on the task at hand that they lose
						track of time.  Strangers find
						themselves talking with and collaborating with each other.
						Taking things apart is a puzzle of sorts: trying to find the right
						order of fasteners to be removed to free a part. Participants become
						intrigued by the parts revealed, wondering what they are and what
						role they played in the device.  These experiences, conversations,
						questions, and discoveries are the elements that make up the formal
						qualities of the work.

						The use of discarded machinery is a subtle critique of our appetite
						for increasingly sophisticated technologies at low prices.
						Manufacturing costs are reduced by removing features allowing
						maintenance and repair, resulting in a high rate of replacement.
						As the vehicle for creating my artwork, the discarded machinery is
						proven not useless.

					"... Bourriaud identifies
					political significance in these relationships as models of interaction
					that critically reflect upon wider society. Bourriaud argues that by
					setting up real interactive situations in the gallery, relational
					works of art do not ‘represent utopias’ but actualise them, creating
					positive ‘life possibilities’ as ‘concrete spaces’ rather than merely
					fictional ones." (Mark Windsor, Art of Interaction: A Theoretical
					Examination of Carsten Höller’s Test Site,
					https://www.tate.org.uk/research/tate-papers/15/art-of-interaction-a-theoretical-examination-of-carsten-holler-test-site)

					“Drawn on Marxian
					language and repurposed by Nicolas Bourriaud in his text Relational
					Aesthetics, the term social interstices refers to a space that
					facilitates human social interaction. Marx refers to the term
					interstice as a pocket of trading activity that stands outside the
					capitalist framework. Similarly, social interstice as Bourriaud uses
					it references a similar defiance of the dominant system. In this case,
					social interstices are those spaces of free interaction that provide
					opportunities for social engagement outside of the norm.” 
					(Social Interstices, Indrani Saha,

					Many of my Relational Aesthetics projects involve disassembling
					discarded devices. For one, these resources are often free, although
					getting access to them is not always easy. There is also something
					subversive about taking something that has been deemed
					"useless" and making new use of it. For more about this, read
					<a href="salvagedMachinery.html"> Salvaged Machinery </a>
					How is permission given to open an appliance or to create art?
					Exclusion is implicit in how we identify ourselves or are identified
					by others ("I'm not good with tools", “I’m not good at math”, “Girls
					don’t build”, “you’re not a real artist”, etc.). In the 
					social interstice 
					and
					actualized utopia 
					of this work, visitors may challenge these identities.
