										Back in 2006 I built a pair of very simple robots
										that could be programmed via the internet. Even then there
										were some examples of robots that could be
										<i>controlled</i> over the internet but this was
										different: you couldn't control the robot directly, and
										there was no webcam, so you couldn't see where you were
										going. Rather, upon connecting to the robot you would get
										a command line, on which you could write a program,
										compile, and run it, which would control the robot. There
										were examples and instructions available via a web server,
										also on the robot. 
										You can see the webpage from 2006 via the 
										<a

										Internet Archive</a>

									<p>
										The robot was available to anyone who
										bothered to connect to it. During the duration of this
										project the robot would suddenly start moving. Unless the
										author explained this in their code, I had no idea who
										wrote the program or what they wanted to do. Most were
										quite simple, but one visitor for example wrote a program
										to make the robot dance.

										There were two versions of this robot.
										This version was part of the

										here</a>
										is some publicity for the opening.
									</p>
							</div>
							<div class="introduction">
									<p>
										The other version of this robot was
										active at home for almost a year while
										people from all over the world connected to it and 
										wrote programs for it. We grew used to it
										starting up and moving around in the middle of the night.

										<i>Robonica</i>
											is a robot that is designed to explore
											telepresence. It is basically a Zoom session
											on wheels. 
											Telepresence robots were invented to 
											enable people to attend events or locations
											that otherwise they would not be able to, 
											whether because of cost, illness, or other limitations.
											The concept of 
											telepresence 
											is not new, and I do not pretend to invent
											it or improve on it. 
										<i>Robonica</i>
											is intentionally made of very simple materials
											and build in a very low-tech manner 
											in order to encourage others to 
											think to themselves that they could build something
											like it, and even improve on it. At that point I 
											would hand them a drill or a soldering iron and say
											Great idea! Go for it
											What I am interested in 
											exploring with this robot 
											are the ideas that people of are not professional
											roboticists.

										<i>Man or Machine</i>
										was designed to explore how people expect robots
										to behave, and how people behave around robots.
										<i>Man or Machine</i>
										will wander around randomly until it identifies
										that it is near a human, and then will 
										ask a question.
										The robot can speak, but can not hear,
										so humans can answer its questions by pushing buttons on
										the front of the robot (e.g. "yes", "no", "other", etc.).
										The next question that the robot
										asks depends on the answer to the previous question. In
										this way the robot engages in a simple conversation.
