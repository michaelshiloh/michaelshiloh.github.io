								<h2>Linux Robots</h2>
									<p>
										Back in 2006 I built a pair of very simple robots
										that could be programmed via the internet. Even then there
										were some examples of robots that could be
										<i>controlled</i> over the internet but this was
										different: you couldn't control the robot directly, and
										there was no webcam, so you couldn't see where you were
										going. Rather, upon connecting to the robot you would get
										a command line, on which you could write a program,
										compile, and run it, which would control the robot. There
										were examples and instructions available via a web server,
										also on the robot. 
										You can see the webpage from 2006 via the 
										[Internet
										Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20060627094924/http://www.linuxrobots.org/wiki/michael_shiloh).
									</p>

									<p>
										The robot was available to anyone who
										bothered to connect to it. During the duration of this
										project the robot would suddenly start moving. Unless the
										author explained this in their code, I had no idea who
										wrote the program or what they wanted to do. Most were
										quite simple, but one visitor for example wrote a program
										to make the robot dance.
									</p>
									
									<p> 
										This robot was part of the [Frankenstein Theory and
										Robotics](https://web.archive.org/web/20060713070158/http://www.sfboca.com/exh/frank_pr.html)
										show at Boca Gallery in 2006. (
										[Publicity](https://web.archive.org/web/20150325104306/http://sf.metblogs.com/2006/06/12/frankenstein-robotics-opening/)
