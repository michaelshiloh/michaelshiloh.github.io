					<p>
						I'm an Associate Professor or Practice at New York University 
						in Abu Dhabi. 
						My passion is building physical things, which here we call
						<i>Physical Computing</i>. My classes are very hands-on
						and involve rapid prototyping with low fidelity materials and
						techniques, lots of feedback, and final projects. I 
						like my students to
						engage critically with topics such as whether (or when) robots
						deserve rights and have responsibilities to society, and appropriate
						and justified uses of technology. 
						I use Arduino extensively although not exclusively. I like it
						because for the most part it just works. The Arduino environment 
						is relatively easy for beginners to get started, and they can
						develop pretty complex projects before running into limitations.

								<h2>Introduction to Interactive Media</h2>
								<p>
									This is the only class I'm teaching that I did not create.  
									As the name suggests it's our basic introductory course to 
									what we call Interactive Media. 
									Topics covered include technology (programming in
									p5.js and electronics using Arduino), human centered design, and
									critique of technology. 
								</p>
								<p>
									Since multiple teachers teach this course, we have a common 
									<a href="https://intro.nyuadim.com/">Wordpress blog</a>
									for the class, but I still keep my own lecture notes and 
									additional
									material in my own course

							<h2>Robota Psyche</h2>
							<p>
								I created this class during the COVID-19 pandemic as an
								alternative to Machine Lab since all teaching was online and
								the intensive building required by Machine Lab would have been
								impossible. This is the only class in which we don't build
								things.  
							</p>

							<p>
								<i>Robota Psyche</i> was inspired by the book 
								<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braitenberg_vehicle">
									<i>Vehicles: Experiments in Synthetic Psychology</i>
								</a>
								by 
								<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valentino_Braitenberg">
										Valentino Braitenberg,
								</a>
								a neuroscientist and cyberneticist. In this short and very
								enjoyable book, Braitenberg leads the reader through a series
								of thought exercises in which he develops vehicles that, with
								combinations of sensors and actuators, can be said to  exhibit
								behaviors such as aggression, love, foresight, and optimism.
							</p>
								
							<p> 
								While Braitenberg's book suggests hardware, the process is
								easily transferable to software, with the great advantage that
								once the code for a vehicle is written, it can be easily
								duplicated, allowing for experimentation with large
								populations of vehicles with similar or different
								"personalities". We can then observe how the vehicles interact
								with each other and their surroundings over time.  
							</p>

								All the course material, as well as links to student Github
								repositories, can be found in the course

							<h2>Interactive Media in the World</h2>
								<p>
									<i>
										Interactive Media in the World
									</i>
									is a course designed to give students 
									a glimpse into how these skills are used 
									such as
									in museums, high tech companies and
									by artists,
									special effects designers,
									exhibit designers, and inventors.
								</p>

								<p>
									Interactive Media spans a large range of activities including
									but certainly not limited to website design and smartphone app
									development; product design; new interfaces for musical
									expression; exhibit design for museums and other institutions;
									kinetic art; interactive art; immersive art; virtual and
									augmented reality; robotics; and education.  These activities
									could take place in individual or collaborative artist
									studios, classrooms, design companies, maker spaces, high tech
									startups, libraries, and a host of other places.  
								</p>

								<p>
									While teaching in the San Francisco Bay Area I had access to
									a great many spaces and practitioners, and could easily show
									students examples of the kind of activities in which they
									could utilize what we were teaching.  Here in Abu Dhabi
									either there isn't such a diversity of activities, or I've
									not found it.  Fortunately, not far away in Israel, I have
									similar access to these spaces through family, friends,
									colleagues, and collaborators.  

								</p>

								<p>
									NYU has a framework in which faculty can propose classes to
									take place in other countries. In my course <i>Interactive
									Media In The World</i> we visit artist studios, design
									studios, "Burning Man" style maker spaces, high tech maker
									spaces, exhibit designers, special effects designers, museums,
									and other creative spaces. We also collaborate with local
									students in simliar classes and engage in a joint project.
